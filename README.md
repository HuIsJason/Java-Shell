# Java-Shell
A course project for CSCB07: Software Design developed in a team of four. Employed Agile and Scrum methodologies to operate in two-week sprint cycles to meet product backlog requirements and reported sprint progress in Scrum meetings.

Implemented Unix-like file system using a tree structure, and an interactive command line with command history using stack structures. Used JUnit unit testing library from Java to create mock objects and develop unit tests for command functionality.
